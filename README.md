# vtt-simple-stealth
This module adds an input field in the token hud to track stealth rolls. It references an actor resource which needs to be called **Stealth** in your system language.

![Example](screenshot_simple-stealth.png)
e.g. in german the resource needs to be called **Heimlichkeit**


## Requirements
Not really required, but if you already use all 3 resources from the 5e sheet, you will need it.
[5eSheet-resourcesPlus](https://github.com/ardittristan/5eSheet-resourcesPlus)

You can also use resourcesPlus to add a fourth resource, call it stealth and then remove the module again, the resource will stay on the actor.
